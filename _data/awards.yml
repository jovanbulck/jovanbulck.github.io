    citation: "The committee was unanimous in recognizing the outstanding contributions made by Jo Van Bulck's dissertation in understanding the limitations in the security guarantees provided by current hardware-assisted isolated execution environments. The work described in the dissertation showed a wide variety of attacks against processor architectures ranging from low-end microprocessors with enclave support to widely deployed processor extensions like Intel SGX. The work has already had a significant impact both in academia as well as in industry, and has been widely recognized. It is no exaggeration to say that Dr. Van Bulck has contributed to launching a new research subfield in systems security."
